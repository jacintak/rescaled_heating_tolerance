Data and code for Heating tolerance of an ectotherm does not vary when temperatureâ€™s influence on biological rates is accounted for.

Files:

 * Supplementary Code.Rmd - Rmarkdown of analysis to generate figures. Requires bibTeX and YAML file
     * rates.bib - bibTeX file
     * bookdown.yml - YAML template for rendering Rmarkdown file
 * rescaled_heating_tolerance_data.csv - Proccessed and exported data from Supplementary Code from line 310. Raw data is available online. Provided as supplementary dataset 1.
 * Morley_et_al_2016.csv - Second dataset of heating tolerances measured under varying heating rates from the same starting temperature. Provided as supplementary dataset 2.
